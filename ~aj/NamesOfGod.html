<h1>Names of God</h1>

<p>

Blessings and praises and happy sabbath day<br>
Here&#39;s a count to recount in this journey on <strong>The Way</strong><br>
We&#39;re the ones, the wayward ones, He came for and equipped<br>
To walk away, and ye to run, from sin and from Egypt

</p>
<p>

Reflect each day, one by one, to 50 as we go
<br>We do this, He taught us . . . and by it, come to know
<br>That <strong>Our Father&#39;s</strong> nation, became in sin a wayward wasteland roamer
<br>An example-to-us, to-retain . . . reflect, and count the Omer.

</p>
<p>

There are many ways to do this, and for comfort here is one
<br>Strike each day with a name, of The <strong>Father</strong>, and <strong>The</strong> <strong>Son</strong>
<br>Names of power, and of peace, names for profit and for trial 
<br>Names of <strong>God</strong>, to weigh on The Way, considering all the while

</p>
<p>

Here&#39;s how it&#39;s done, I&#39;ll show you some, His names to get us started
<br>Names of the <strong>One</strong> who by His <strong>Son</strong>, wide the waters parted
<br><strong>Adonai,</strong>  <strong>El-Shaddai,</strong>    <strong>King,</strong>   and  <strong>Elohim</strong>
<br><strong>Son-of-the Most High,   JEHOVAH&mdash;YAHWEH,  Teacher,   Nazarene</strong>

</p>
<p>

Only a-few names in, yet stirring within
<br>Our hearts is strength by voicing
<br>The name of Him who is-like med-i-cine
<br>And cause for great rejoicing

</p>
<p>

<strong>Man of sorrows</strong>, <strong>Mighty One</strong>, <strong>Messiah</strong>, and <strong>Omega</strong>
<br><strong>Alpha,  Leader,  Lord of Lords,  Lion of the Tribe of Judah</strong>

</p>
<p>

<strong>Rabbi,  Prophet,  Prince of Peace,  Redeemer, Purifier</strong>
<br><strong>Resurrection,  Righteous One,  Rock, Refiners-Fire</strong>

</p>
<p>

Oh but, when we get in a rut, with faith in the foe-names we hiss
<br>And as words give <em>them</em> power and we start to cower it sounds something like this
<br>Anakin giants lie ahead and Pharaoh breaths hot at our back
<br>And worse than <em>this</em> heat,  is our fear of defeat, it&#39;s faith we typically lack

</p>
<p>

Now this is the chance, the circumstance, exactly the type of hour 
<br>To get up from the dust and speak in trust the name of our <strong>High Tower</strong>
<br>So let&#39;s gather our stammer and strike with His banner a Mighty name of <strong>The Lord</strong>
<br><strong>Deliverer</strong> is chosen as we rush the heaps frozen, and dry, the Red-Sea we ford

</p>
<p>

Dear God He saves us from our foes, and even from ourselves
<br>Him none can oppose, so cast Him your woes, He&#39;ll crush all the various hells

</p>
<p>

He&#39;s <strong>Our Peace</strong> and our <strong>Potter</strong> He&#39;s <strong>Living Water,</strong> 
<br>He&#39;s <strong>Source</strong> and <strong>Shield</strong> and <strong>Light</strong>
<br>Like a  <strong>Lamb</strong> to the slaughter was He the silent <strong>Author,</strong>
<br><strong>And Finisher,</strong> we wield in our fight

</p>
<p>

As we think on these names, and trod through the pains, our road with hope we pave
<br>Because His every title, for our recital, can turn a timid heart brave
<br>Let&#39;s see an example the choices are ample, let&#39;s strike at the giants of strife
<br>With the names of Him on whom we depend <strong>The Way, The Truth, The Life</strong>

</p>
<p>

Is affliction what ails, or some some mean thing that threatens your health?
<br>Does sickness assail to no doctors avail and gobble your money and wealth?
<br>Consider she, who was made to be free, 12 years her bank and body bled
<br>Then came she, Yahweh-Rapha to see, to <strong>The Lord our Healer</strong> she tread 
<br>As the crowd pressed in, she touched only His hem, as she reached for the <strong>King of Kings</strong>
<br>So If <em>your</em> blood rushes thin, stumble to Him, and call on the health in His wings

</p>
<p>

Ah but some may say, sick people die every day and where was the healing for them
<br>Good people they, who would pray every day, and kneeling said send <strong>The</strong> <strong>Amen</strong>
<br>And when children are some for whom death beats the drum, what name possibly consoles
<br>Here&#39;s one for the parent whose heart is despair-rent: <strong>Daddy</strong> and <strong>Shepherd of our Souls</strong>
<br>Yes not even death defeats the giver of breath so take heart you fathers and mothers
<br>It&#39;s mean and it&#39;s sad but stand and be glad, not even death can beat up <em>your</em> <strong>Dad</strong>

</p>
<p>

So you see we are conquerers you and me, He knows our pain and sees us
<br>No height or depth no-not-even Death keeps us from the love of God in <strong>Jesus</strong>

</p>
<p>

So don&#39;t let fear give you doubt? <strong>Love</strong> is the perfect cast-out
<br>Strike at your dread and your terror, 
<br>To wipe out this stain, <strong>on</strong> <strong>Love</strong> is the name
<br>To cast all your worry and care

</p>
<p>

Want treasure in heaven? He&#39;s your banker
<br>Got storms  in life, He&#39;s your <strong>Anchor</strong>
<br>Is addiction your war? He&#39;s the <strong>Door</strong>
<br>Choices wide, He&#39;s the <strong>Guide</strong>
<br>Been betrayed, all alone, need a <strong>Rock?</strong> He&#39;s a <strong>Stone</strong>
<br>Need a hand He&#39;s the <strong>Right</strong>
<br>For your night He is <strong>Light</strong>
<br>When you choose your preacher? He&#39;s <em>the</em> <strong>Teacher</strong>
<br>For your hunger, it is said, He&#39;s the <strong>Bread</strong>
<br>For your wine He&#39;s the <strong>Vine</strong>
<br>For every blessing and every bother turn to God He&#39;s your <strong>Father</strong>

</p>
<p>

So you see of Him we sing, He is all, He is everything
<br>Sing and praise the <strong>Ancient of Days</strong>
<br>And say amen to <strong>The beginning</strong> and <strong>The End,</strong> 
<br>He<strong>&#39;s</strong> called <strong>Gentle</strong> <strong>Whisper,</strong> and <strong>Our Passover Lamb</strong>
<br><strong>Lord of All</strong>, the <strong>Great I Am</strong>
